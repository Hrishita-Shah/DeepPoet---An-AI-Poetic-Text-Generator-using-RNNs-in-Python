# DeepPoet---An-AI-Poetic-Text-Generator-using-RNNs-in-Python
An open-source Python repo combining poetry's beauty with RNNs. Trained on curated datasets, it crafts captivating and soulful poetry. Delve into code, data prep, and model training for AI-generated verses. Aspiring poets, ML enthusiasts, and researchers find inspiration hereâ€”where creativity meets technology.

DeepPoet is a Python script that uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate captivating and soulful poetry. This project aims to bring together the beauty of poetry and machine learning prowess through an easy-to-use script that you can run in Google Colab.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Hrishita-Shah/DeepPoet---An-AI-Poetic-Text-Generator-using-RNNs-in-Python.git

cd DeepPoet

### Running in Google Colab

1. Open Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Upload the `deep_poet.py` script to Google Colab.
3. Run the script and follow the instructions to generate poetic texts.

## How it Works

1. The `deep_poet.py` script uses pre-trained RNN models to generate poetry.
2. You can provide a custom seed text to influence the generated poem's style.
3. Based on your input, The model will generate the desired number of characters.

## Customization

- To influence the generated poems, you can experiment with different seed texts in the `deep_poet.py` script.
- To train your own RNN model with custom datasets, consider using the full DeepPoet repository available on GitHub.
